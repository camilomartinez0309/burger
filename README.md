## Burger Listing

- fetch the data from api and also add 1 second to revalidate the api if there is change. It is called incremental Static site generation

## Burger Detail page
- It is server render static page that generate on build time
- I use Listing api to extract the data to specific burger because there is no api for detail 
- also added SEO that is generated dynamically

## Cart page
- I use local storage for cart management . user can add, delete, and update the cart
